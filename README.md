## Introduction

In this data mining assignment, we have analyzed and explored three different datasets using Python, R, and Weka. The datasets include a weather dataset, a healthcare service dataset, and a real estate dataset. Each dataset has been analyzed and processed to derive valuable insights.

## Project Structure

- Data_Analysis_using_Python notebook contains the Python-based analysis for the weather dataset.
- Data_Analysis_using_R notebook contains the R-based analysis for the healthcare service dataset.

## Prerequisites

- Python (for the Python-Weather analysis)
- R (for the R-Healthcare-Service analysis)
- Weka (for the Weka-Real-Estate analysis)
- Jupyter Notebook (for viewing the Python analysis)
- Any code editor for R scripts
- Weka GUI (for Weka analysis)

## Execution Steps

Here are the detailed steps to execute and explore the project:

### Python-Weather Analysis
1. Open the Data_Analysis_using_Python Jupyter Notebook file .
2. Run each cell to execute the Python-based analysis of the weather dataset.
3. The notebook provides explanations for each task and analysis.

### R-Healthcare-Service Analysis
1. Open the R script in the Data_Analysis_using_R Notebook using any code editor for R scripts.
2. Run the script to execute the R-based analysis of the healthcare service dataset.
3. The script provides explanations for each task and analysis.

### Weka-Real-Estate Analysis
1. Open the Weka GUI.
2. Load the provided real estate dataset (`Housing.csv` file) using Weka.
3. Use Weka's graphical interface to perform analysis on the real estate dataset.

## Datasets

- **Weather Dataset**: Contains information related to weather conditions and temperatures.
- **Healthcare Service Dataset**: Contains data related to healthcare services and patient information.
- **Real Estate Dataset**: Contains data about real estate listings, including property details.

## Tasks and Analysis

The project involves the following tasks and analyses:
- Data preprocessing
- Statistical exploratory data analysis
- Visualization of data
- Identifying interesting patterns in the datasets

## Results

The project has provided various insights and patterns found within the datasets. 


Feel free to explore the provided analysis scripts and datasets to gain insights into the project's findings.

Enjoy exploring the world of data mining!
